# COP 3710: Airline Operations Analysis
## Project Scope
The project lies within the domain of transportation analytics, specificially aviation operation analytics. The
primary goal of this project is to analyze U.S. flight data to determine and understand causes behind flight delays.
With these delay causes determined, this project will aid in improving efficiency within airline operations and
airports.
## Intended Users
The intended users of this database are airline operation analysts and airport management, as they will attempt
to optimize traffic efficiency for arriving and departing flights by minimalizing delays. Additional users include
travelers looking to trends within flight delays and researchers studying data on flight operations.
